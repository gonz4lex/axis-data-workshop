# Issues raised with Big Data

### Moore's Law

.pull-left[
Every two years, computing power increases by a factor of two.
Data follows the same path, but does knowledge?


> Data is widely available; what is scarce is the ability to extract wisdom from it.
(Hal Varian)


> We are overwhelmed by information, not because there is too much, but because we don't know how to tame it. 
(Stephen Few)

# The curse of dimensionality

Big Data problems are usually due to a high number of attributes rather than observations. This has several undesired effects:

--

1. Computational workload

--

1. Dimensional redundancy

--

1. Overfitting

# Solutions


The cross validation or holdout methods assess how the results of our analysis will generalize to an independent dataset.

# Dimensionality reduction

- __Principal Component Analysis__: create new variables as linear, orthogonal combinations of features.

--

- __Partial Least Squares__: similar to PCA, uses the annotated label to maximize inter-class variance.

# Dimensionality reduction

- __Canonical Correlation Analysis__: find relationships from cross-covariance matrices.

--

- __Discriminant Analysis__: mainly for classification, can be used for reduction.

# Sparse Data

__The Netflix Prize__ was an open competition for the best collaborative filtering algorithm to predict user ratings for films, based on previous ratings without any other information about the users or films, i.e. without the users or the films being identified except by numbers assigned for the contest.
