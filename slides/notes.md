* Data is widely available; what is scarce is the ability to extract wisdom from it. (Hal Varian)
* Big Data is like teenage sex: everybody talks about it, nobody really know how to do it, everyone thinks everyone else is doing it so everyone claims they are doing it. (Dan Ariely)

#### What this is

Some considerations when working with big data, high-level overview of complex statistical techniques, applications of big data and just a little bit of math. Bonus: k Nearest Neighbours algorithm, time permitting.

#### What this is not

Detailed explanations of algorithms, technical knowledge and considerations for big data processing. 

### Topics

* Four V's of Big Data:
    + Volume
    + Velocity
    + Variety
    + Veracity: note that Big Data can also be Garbage Data.

* Moore's Law:
    + Every two years, computing power increases by a factor of 2.
    + Data follows the same path, but does knowledge?

* Overfitting:
    + Training and validation splits
    + Cross validation

* Curse of dimensionality (p > n)

* Dimensionality reduction
  + Principal Component Analysis: create new variables as linear, orthogonal combinations of features.
  + Partial Least Squares: similar to PCA, uses the annotated label to maximize inter-class variance.
  + Discriminant Analysis (Linear and Quadratic): mainly for classification, can be used for reduction
  + Canonical Correlation Analysis: finds relationships from cross-covariance matrices.
  + Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO): performs feature selection due to penalties in cost function.
  
* Sparse Data
    + The Netflix Prize: users only vote a subset of movies.

* Artificial Intelligence
    + Deep Learning
    + Reinforcement Learning
    + Computer Vision

* Natural Language Processing
    + Sentiment Analysis
    + Machine Translation
    + Bayesian Spam Filtering: word frequency in spam v. non-spam document corpus
    + Chatbots

Not sure if this next section will be included, perhaps it's better suited for Nacho's talk.
