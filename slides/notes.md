## Notes for the talk

* Data is widely available; what is scarce is the ability to extract wisdom from it. (Hal Varian)
* Big Data is like teenage sex: everybody talks about it, nobody really know how to do it, everyone thinks everyone else is doing it so everyone claims they are doing it. (Dan Ariely)
